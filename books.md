My favourites
--------------------

[The Linux Programming Interface](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/the_linux_interface_programming.pdf): This is my top 1 favorite book. It helped me deeply understand C programming in Linux environment. C is a programming language that quite closes to the hardware where you have to handle resources such as memories, files, etc by yourself. In other programming languages (Java, etc.), garbage collection is automatically handled by a dedicated agent. This book covers many essential topics in Linux programming such as Files, Memories, Interprocess Communication, Sockets, etc.

[CS329S Lecture Notes](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/cs329s_lecture_note.pdf): This is a draft version of the well-known book: Designing Machine Learning Systems of Huyen Chip. Actually, this is the lecture notes I collected from her CS329S courses in Stanford University. The book is really interesting to read. It shows you how a real AI/ML application is deployed in the industry/enterprise. Please support the author by purchasing the book if you can. Otherwise, you can contact me to get the epub version of her lecture notes.

[The Complete Reference C++](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/the_complete_reference_cpp.pdf): I used to think it is easy to learn C++ if I have good background in C. However, using C++ is tough and I had a hard time studying the OPP in C++. It is even more difficult than the OPP in Python or Java (in my personal opinion). This book, as its name, is a reference that guides you how to code in C++ appropriately and avoid potential bugs. It is really easy to use C++ in a wrong way and cause bugs if we use python mindset applying in C++. I (and maybe many others) cannot remember everything so I use this book as a guideline where I can look up when facing a certain topic in C++. By the way, reading top-down is also helpful.

[Machine Learning cơ bản](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/machine_learning_co_ban.pdf): This book is the reason why I start learning AI/ML. I used to be an embedded software engineer in Vietnam. This Vietnamese book gives me a friendly approach for the person starting learning AI/ML (like me) (obviously because it is in Vietnamese and I am). Shout out for Vu Huu Tiep, the author of this book that writes the book for free without any benefit but helping the beginner start learning AI/ML easier. AI/ML may be painful for those who starts from scratch. This book will help you (if you are a Vietnamese) by covering almost every basic topics of machine learning. By the way, "cơ bản" means "basic" in Vietnamese.

[Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/computer_networking_top_down.pdf): It is so shame when I am a Telecommunication-major student but have zero knowledge in Computer Networking until I read this book. My boss in Viettel (Big telecommunication company in Vietnam) recommended this book. It helps me understand (somehow) how the computer network works. Even though I am not a expert in Computer Network, I can implement the network protocols and troubleshoot some easy network issues.

[Adaptive Filter Theory](https://github.com/khanhnd185/books/blob/master/adaptive_filter_theory.pdf): This book is recommended by my boss in AI company. The book covers many topics in adaptive filter theory. Many of them are premitive ideas for AI/ML disciplines. If you wonder where the AI/ML methods come from, this book may give you a historical background of your concern.
